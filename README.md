# Arys-CustomAssetImporter

The purpose of this framework is to simplify the process for mod creators who wish to implement custom assets such as (particle system) effects into SPT-AKI.

This client mod framework will load any Unity asset bundles placed within the specified folders and import them into the game.

## Instructions for Mod users

- Download the latest release
- Extract the .zip to your SPT folder

## Instructions for Modders

You will need to add the corresponding template script/component for whatever type of asset you want to add into the game.

The templates will be located in the `AssetImporter/Templates` folder in this Git repository.

Please download *only* the templates; the rest of the project is intended as a client mod framework which all users, will need to install to make use of these custom assets.

### So how do I (a modder) use it?
